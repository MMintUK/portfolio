title: KIM JONG UN & FRIENDS | JAPAN
description: |
  ‘Kim Jong Un & Friends’ - This collage piece was originally for a magazine commission I worked on which focused on the human rights issues in North Korea. A human rights commissioner was slandered by the North Korean regime for being gay, this piece play a twist on the story and hopefully sheds some light on the injustices happening within North Korea.
